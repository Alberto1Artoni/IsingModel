# IsingModel
Some ludical stuff about Ising Model. Most of the implementation follows Menche,Lipowski,Valleriani's paper.

Code is written in Mathematica and exploits the IGraph library.

Overall the code is badly written and needs a little bit of introduction to help the user. It's not meant for the public.
